# JavaScript Tasks

To give you some practical tasks to complete with JavaScript we have set up some examples in CodePen for you to complete. Each example includes some HTML and CSS plus a JavaScript file which you will need to edit in order to complete the task.

Before starting to write any code:

- Ensure you are logged in to CodePen
- Click the "fork" button at the bottom right of the screen

- Navigate to your own pens
- Open the forked version of the exercise

Once you have completed each task submit the link to the pen.

### THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:

- **Save your work!** CodePen has an autosave feature but don't rely on it, save manually often.
- CodePen has a built-in console but it can be a bit unresponsive if there's a lot going on. Everything is still being run in the browser though, meaning you can use your browser's built-in console for any logging or inspection you want to do.
